# Command: Bootstrap Feature

## Agency Documentation Pipeline

Every feature follows this pipeline before any code is written. Each step is performed by a specialized agent role.

### Step 0: Verify plan exists

Before invoking ANY agent, the orchestrator MUST verify that `<project>/.claude/plan.md` exists and is non-empty. The check is the literal Bash test:

```
[ -s .claude/plan.md ] || {
  echo "error: .claude/plan.md not found. Enter plan mode first (/plan), complete the plan, and exit plan mode — Claude will automatically save the plan to .claude/plan.md before exiting."
  exit 1
}
```

The `-s` operator returns success only when the file exists AND has size greater than zero — empty (0-byte) files are treated as missing. If the check fails, abort the bootstrap run immediately. Do NOT invoke `prd-writer`, `ba-analyst`, `architect`, `qa-planner`, `planner`, `resource-architect`, or `role-planner`.

The check is presence-and-non-empty only — structural validation of the plan body is the planner's responsibility at Step 5. The producer side of this contract is the `### Plan-Mode Persistence` rule in `src/claude.md`, which mandates that Claude Write the plan body to `.claude/plan.md` before calling `ExitPlanMode`.

### Step 1: Product Manager — PRD Documentation
Delegate to `prd-writer` agent:
- Read `docs/PRD.md` to understand the existing format
- Add a new section documenting the feature's requirements
- Include: feature description, user story, functional/non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, affected endpoints, schema changes, UI changes

### Step 2: Business Analyst — Use Cases
Delegate to `ba-analyst` agent:
- Read `docs/PRD.md` for the feature requirements just documented
- Create `docs/use-cases/<feature-slug>_use_cases.md`
- Document ALL scenarios: primary flows, alternative flows, error flows, edge cases
- Include actors, preconditions, postconditions, data requirements
- This document becomes the blueprint for E2E testing

### Step 3: Software Architect — Architecture Review
Delegate to `architect` agent:
- Read PRD and use-case documents
- Validate the approach against project structure defined in CLAUDE.md
- Check module boundaries
- Review any schema changes for data integrity
- Verify API design follows REST conventions
- Flag components needing security pre-review during implementation

#### If Architecture Review FAILS:
1. Read the architect's specific objections
2. Revise the approach to address each violation
3. Re-submit to `architect` for review
4. Retry up to 2 times
5. If still rejected: document the architectural concern in scratchpad as a blocker and ask the user

### Step 3.5: Resource Manager-Architect recommendation (CONDITIONAL — auto-detection)

Delegate to `resource-architect` agent **only when** one of the following conditions holds:

**(A) Keyword auto-detection** (default path, no flag required). Scan the
PRD section authored at Step 1 AND the use-cases file authored at Step 2
for any of the case-insensitive trigger keywords below. If at least one
match is found, proceed with the agent dispatch below. If zero matches,
SKIP Step 3.5 silently and emit a single one-line note to the bootstrap
output: `Step 3.5 skipped — no external-resource keywords detected in
PRD/use-cases. Use /bootstrap-feature --with-resources to force-run.`

Trigger keywords (any one match → run): `third-party`, `third party`,
`external API`, `external SDK`, `external service`, `MCP`, `MCP server`,
`OAuth`, `auth provider`, `compliance`, `regulated`, `regulatory`,
`vendor`, `subscription`, `billing`, `cloud storage`, `S3`, `Stripe`,
`Twilio`, `SendGrid`, `Auth0`, `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `webhook`,
`integration`.

**(B) Explicit override flag** — when the user invokes the command as
`/bootstrap-feature --with-resources <feature-description>`, force-run
Step 3.5 regardless of keyword scan outcome. The flag is parsed from the
command argument string by the orchestrator before any agent dispatch.

When neither (A) nor (B) applies, Step 3.5 is SKIPPED — the
`.claude/resources-pending.md` temp file is NOT created, and the
downstream `planner` agent at Step 5 handles the absence per its
existing graceful-skip contract (Process step 4a — "If the temp file
itself does not exist, skip silently — no error, no warning, and do
not add a `## Recommended Resources` section").

This conditional pattern replaces the iter-1 MANDATORY contract for
Step 3.5 — it cuts ~1 agent call per bootstrap on the common case
(features with no external dependencies). Step 3.75 (`role-planner`)
remains MANDATORY and non-skippable. A feature that DOES match a
trigger keyword (or uses `--with-resources`) and yet requires no
external resources still produces an explicit `No external resources
required` body with all six category headings each showing `(none)`.

The agent reads the following four inputs (in this fixed order):
1. The PRD section just written at Step 2 in `docs/PRD.md`
2. The use-cases file `docs/use-cases/<feature-slug>_use_cases.md` produced at Step 2
3. The architect's PASS verdict text from Step 3 — the orchestrator captures this text and inlines it into the `resource-architect` spawn prompt as context
4. The project `CLAUDE.md`

The agent does **NOT** read `.claude/scratchpad.md`.

**Expected output:** exactly one file at `.claude/resources-pending.md` in the project CWD, formatted as a top-level `## Recommended Resources` section with a summary line and six `### <Category>` subheadings (MCP, Cloud/Compute, External API, Third-party Service, Library/Framework, Hardware) in that fixed order. Empty categories render `(none)` on their own line.

**On failure:** `/bootstrap-feature` MUST report the failure and MUST NOT proceed to Step 4. Bootstrap halts at Step 3.5 and is reported as blocked to the user. The subsequent steps (Step 4 QA Lead, Step 5 Tech Lead) are not executed until the resource-architect failure is resolved.

**Hand-off to Step 5 (Tech Lead — Implementation Planning):** the planner agent reads `.claude/resources-pending.md`, inlines its content verbatim as the first top-level `## Recommended Resources` section of `.claude/plan.md` (placed immediately before `## Prerequisites verified`), and then **MUST delete** `.claude/resources-pending.md`. The temp file is ephemeral per-bootstrap.

#### Iteration-2 Auto-Install Phase (extension of Step 3.5)

The iter-2 extension adds a post-suggestion auto-install phase to Step 3.5. This phase EXTENDS the iter-1 suggestion behavior; it does NOT replace it. The numbered substeps below execute IN ORDER, all within Step 3.5 (the step number does NOT increment to 3.6 or 3.51 — the renumbering is intentionally avoided to preserve existing references and dependency edges).

**(a) Iter-1 suggestion produced first.** The agent first writes the iter-1 `## Recommended Resources` section to `.claude/resources-pending.md` exactly as documented above. The auto-install phase MUST NOT begin until this file exists with valid iter-1 content. If the iter-1 suggestion fails, Step 3.5 FAILS and bootstrap halts (no auto-install attempted).

**(b) Agent emits an approval-prompt block.** After the suggestion file is written, the agent emits a single ephemeral approval-prompt block to its stdout (NOT written to any file). The prompt header is the literal `Auto-install approval required:`; the body groups Trivial items per category and lists Moderate items per-item; the footer reads `Sensitive-tier items (if any) will be presented separately for manual action.` Forbidden items are absent from this prompt — they are surfaced only via the iter-1 suggestion section per the canonical Forbidden handling.

**(c) Orchestrator displays the prompt and captures the user reply.** The `/bootstrap-feature` orchestrator surfaces the approval-prompt block to the user verbatim and captures their reply. Affirmative tokens (yes/y/approve/ok/agreed/please do/go ahead) approve; negative tokens (no/n/decline/skip/not now) decline; ambiguous replies default-deny. Bulk replies (e.g., "yes to Trivial, no to Moderate") are honored; per-item overrides are accepted. Approval is ephemeral — no reply is persisted to disk.

**(d) Agent runs approved Trivial/Moderate sequentially under the whitelist.** For each approved item the agent runs detect-then-install commands sequentially (no parallel execution) using ONLY whitelisted Bash invocations (FR-5.4 anchored regex whitelist + redundant deny-list — see `src/agents/resource-architect.md` §Bash Whitelist). Sensitive items are NOT auto-executed; each Sensitive item raises a Rule 4 escalation per `~/.claude/rules/error-recovery.md` and the agent continues with non-Sensitive items. A whitelist violation (any command failing the anchored regex match) is an `aborted-whitelist-violation`: the entire auto-install phase HALTS, Step 3.5 FAILS, and bootstrap halts (no further substeps execute).

**(e) Agent appends `## Auto-Install Results` to the temp file.** After the install phase completes (or is bypassed per the headless contract below), the agent APPENDS a single `## Auto-Install Results` top-level section to `.claude/resources-pending.md` AFTER the existing `## Recommended Resources` section. The `## Recommended Resources` section MUST remain byte-for-byte unchanged. The status enum and section format are pinned in `src/agents/resource-architect.md` §Output Extension — Auto-Install Results.

**Headless contract (per [STRUCTURAL] decision 5).** When the orchestrator detects a non-interactive context — `process.stdin.isTTY === false` (or the equivalent Claude Code session attribute that indicates the absence of an interactive TTY) — the orchestrator MUST skip the approval prompt at substep (c) entirely; the agent MUST bypass install execution at substep (d); and the agent MUST write the literal string `Skipped: non-interactive context — auto-install requires user approval` as the body of the `## Auto-Install Results` section at substep (e). Bootstrap then proceeds to Step 3.75 normally. The headless contract MUST NOT itself fail Step 3.5.

**Step 3.5 success/failure semantics.** Step 3.5 SUCCEEDS unless one of these two conditions occurs: (a) the iter-1 suggestion at substep (a) fails to produce a valid `.claude/resources-pending.md`, OR (b) an FR-5.4 whitelist violation halts the auto-install phase at substep (d) (status `aborted-whitelist-violation` ⇒ Step 3.5 FAILS and bootstrap halts). All other auto-install phase outcomes — Trivial/Moderate execution failures (`approved-but-failed`), Sensitive Rule 4 escalations (`aborted-sensitive`), version conflicts (`aborted-version-conflict`), already-present skips (`skipped-already-present`), detection failures (`aborted-detection-failed`), and not-approved declines (`not-approved`) — DO NOT fail Step 3.5; the bootstrap proceeds to Step 3.75.

**Mandatory vs. skippable.** Step 3.5 itself remains MANDATORY and non-skippable per the iter-1 contract above. The auto-install phase WITHIN Step 3.5 (substeps (b)–(d)) MAY be skipped by the user replying "no" to all approval prompts at substep (c) OR by the headless contract bypassing the prompt; in either case substep (e) still executes (with `not-approved` statuses or the literal headless `Skipped:` body, respectively) and Step 3.5 SUCCEEDS.

### Step 3.75: Role Planner recommendation

Delegate to `role-planner` agent. This step is **MANDATORY and non-skippable** — it runs on every feature regardless of whether project-specific specialized roles are needed. A feature that genuinely needs no additional roles produces an explicit `No additional roles required.` body in `.claude/roles-pending.md`; it MUST NOT be skipped.

The agent reads the following five inputs (in this fixed order):
1. The PRD section just written at Step 2 in `docs/PRD.md`
2. The use-cases file `docs/use-cases/<feature-slug>_use_cases.md` produced at Step 2
3. The architect's PASS verdict text from Step 3 — the orchestrator captures this text and inlines it into the `role-planner` spawn prompt as context (the agent does NOT read it from disk)
4. `.claude/resources-pending.md` if it exists (produced by `resource-architect` at Step 3.5) — used as context to avoid duplicating resource-level recommendations as roles
5. The project `CLAUDE.md`

The agent does **NOT** read `.claude/scratchpad.md`.

**Expected outputs:**
- Exactly one temp file at `.claude/roles-pending.md` in the project CWD, formatted as a top-level `## Additional Roles` section with a summary line, zero-or-more `#### <Role Title>` per-role blocks (each with the 5 FR-1.4 fields: Role title, Slug, Why, Pipeline step, Purpose), and a `## Role invocation plan` subsection.
- Zero-or-more on-demand prompt files at `~/.claude/agents/ondemand-<slug>.md` (one per recommended role). These persist after the bootstrap completes — they are the runtime artifacts that future `subagent_type: general-purpose` invocations source.

**On failure:** `/bootstrap-feature` MUST report the failure and **MUST NOT proceed to Step 4**. Bootstrap halts at Step 3.75 with an error and is reported as blocked to the user. The subsequent steps (Step 4 QA Lead, Step 5 Tech Lead) are not executed until the role-planner failure is resolved.

**Hand-off to Step 5 (Tech Lead — Implementation Planning):** the planner agent reads `.claude/roles-pending.md`, inlines its content verbatim as the top-level `## Additional Roles` section of `.claude/plan.md` (placed after `## Recommended Resources` if any and before `## Prerequisites verified`), and then **MUST delete** `.claude/roles-pending.md`. The planner is also responsible for deleting `.claude/resources-pending.md` independently (per Step 3.5 hand-off). Both temp-file deletions are independent: the planner MUST delete each file separately, and a failure to delete one MUST NOT prevent or block the deletion of the other. Each temp file is ephemeral per-bootstrap.

#### Iteration-2 reuse extension (Stage-2 prompt orchestration + derivation + headless contract)

The iter-2 extension augments Step 3.75 with an existing-role reuse pathway BEFORE the Stage 3 (create new) pathway runs. This extension EXTENDS the iter-1 hand-off above; it does NOT replace it. The clauses below execute within Step 3.75 (the step number does NOT increment to 3.76, 3.751, or 3.755 — the renumbering is intentionally avoided to preserve existing references and dependency edges).

**Project-name derivation (FR-1.3).** The orchestrator computes the `<project-name>` token as `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` BEFORE spawning the `role-planner` agent. If `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` errors (the working directory is not inside a git repository), the orchestrator passes the literal string `unknown-project` to the agent as the `<project-name>` token. The orchestrator (NOT the agent — `role-planner` has no Bash tool) performs this Bash invocation. The derived value is passed via the spawn-context channel as a named token; the agent does NOT shell out.

**Feature-slug derivation (FR-1.4).** The orchestrator computes the `<feature-slug>` token from the current branch name with the `feat/` or `fix/` prefix stripped. If the current branch is NOT of the form `feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>` (e.g. `main`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, detached HEAD, or any other shape), the orchestrator MUST refuse to compute a feature-slug for the reuse path. In that case the reuse-scan still runs (read-only, no side effects), but the agent receives no `<feature-slug>` token and falls through to Stage 3 (create new) for all recommendations, with a manual-slug warning emitted to the audit log. Newly-created on-demand prompt files in this case have an empty `features: []` array in their frontmatter (documented technical debt — operator must hand-edit later).

**Stage-2 reuse-prompt orchestration (FR-2.3).** When the agent emits a Stage-2 prompt of the literal form `Reuse existing role 'ondemand-<existing-slug>' for current feature, or create new 'ondemand-<new-slug>'? [yes/no]`, the `/bootstrap-feature` orchestrator MUST: (1) display the prompt verbatim to the user with the existing file's `description` frontmatter field appended as a one-line summary, (2) capture the user's free-form text reply, (3) pass the reply back to the `role-planner` agent via the spawn-context channel for parsing under the FR-2.4 affirmative/negative token grammar with default-deny on ambiguous. This is the same orchestration pattern as Section 7 FR-4.3 (resource-architect approval prompt) — the orchestrator is the I/O boundary; the agent is the parser.

**Sequential prompting (FR-2.5).** The orchestrator MUST emit Stage-2 prompts ONE AT A TIME per ambiguous recommendation. NO batching of multiple prompts into a single user-facing message. Each prompt is emitted, the user's reply is captured, parsed, and the decision is recorded BEFORE the next prompt is emitted. The order of prompts follows the order of recommendations in the agent's iter-1 `## Additional Roles` body of `.claude/roles-pending.md` (top-to-bottom textual order — no re-sorting).

**Headless contract (FR-6.1, FR-6.4).** The orchestrator detects a non-interactive context via `process.stdin.isTTY === false` (or the equivalent shell test `[ -t 0 ]` returning false). The detection mechanism MUST match Section 7 FR-7.4 (resource-architect headless detection) — same primitive, same semantics, no drift. When the context is non-interactive: the orchestrator MUST SKIP all Stage-2 prompts entirely; the agent MUST default to Stage 3 (create new) for every Stage-2 candidate; audit-trail entries for these decisions are recorded with the literal status string `headless-default-create`. Stage 1 (exact slug, automatic reuse without prompting) is UNAFFECTED — Stage 1 runs without prompting and is therefore safe in headless contexts; only Stage 2 (the user-prompted ambiguous-similarity path) is bypassed.

**Hand-off addendum.** The orchestrator's prior Step 3.75 hand-off (the planner inlines `.claude/roles-pending.md` into `.claude/plan.md`, then deletes the temp file) IS PRESERVED unchanged by this extension. The new `## Reuse Decisions` subsection added by FR-8.1 is a SUBSECTION of `.claude/roles-pending.md` and is inlined transparently into `.claude/plan.md` along with the rest of the file — no planner prompt change is required (handled by the planner's existing whole-file inline behavior). The temp file deletion semantics from the iter-1 hand-off above apply identically.

**Step 3.75 SUCCESS / FAILURE semantics.** Step 3.75 SUCCEEDS unless the agent's reuse-scan or any Stage-1/Stage-2/Stage-3 path produces an unrecoverable I/O failure. The following outcomes are explicitly NOT failures — they are recorded in the audit trail (under `## Reuse Decisions` in `.claude/roles-pending.md`) and Step 3.75 SUCCEEDS:
- Stage-2 ambiguous-default-deny outcomes (user reply parsed as ambiguous → default-deny → fall through to create-new),
- headless-default-create outcomes (non-interactive context → all Stage-2 candidates default to create-new),
- legacy-migration outcomes (existing prompt files lacking iter-2 frontmatter fields are migrated in place per FR-7.x),
- malformed-yaml-skipped outcomes (existing prompt files with unparseable frontmatter are skipped from the reuse scan and treated as create-new candidates).

The mandatory and non-skippable nature of Step 3.75 from Section 5 FR-3.2 is PRESERVED — the iter-2 extension does NOT introduce any user-facing skip path. The step number REMAINS `3.75` — no renumbering to `3.76`, `3.751`, or `3.755`.

### Step 4: QA Lead — Test Case Documentation
Delegate to `qa-planner` agent:
- Read `docs/PRD.md` AND `docs/use-cases/<feature-slug>_use_cases.md`
- Create `docs/qa/<feature-slug>_test_cases.md`
- Map every use-case scenario to test cases (UC-1 → TC-1.1, UC-1-E1 → TC-1.2, etc.)
- Cover: happy path, alternative flows, errors, edge cases, auth boundaries, concurrency

### Step 5: Tech Lead — Implementation Planning
Delegate to `planner` agent:
- Read ALL documentation created above: PRD, use cases, architecture review, test cases
- Read the project's CLAUDE.md for file structure and conventions
- Break the feature into 5-9 testable implementation slices
- Each slice references which use-case scenarios it implements (UC-X.Y)
- Flag slices needing architect or security pre-review
- Reference actual project files discovered during exploration

### Step 5.5: Release Scribe — Initial Changelog Stub
Delegate to `changelog-writer` agent with no arguments beyond the project CWD context (per FR-4.6). This is the first lifecycle hook — it produces an initial `[Unreleased]` stub (or, more commonly, returns `no-op: already in sync` / `no-op: no eligible entries` when the branch has no prior eligible commits). A `no-op: not configured` response is expected when running inside the SDLC repo itself and is treated as success. This hook is non-blocking per FR-4.5: if the agent fails, log the error and continue to Step 6.

### Step 6: Git Setup
- Verify `git status` is clean
- Create feature branch: `feat/<feature-slug>`

### Step 7: Initialize Scratchpad
Update `.claude/scratchpad.md` with the full feature context:
- Feature name and branch
- Status: "implementing wave 1 slice 1/N" (when plan has `Wave:` fields) or "implementing slice 1/N" (when no wave assignments)
- Full plan with slices grouped by wave: each wave as a `### Wave N` subheading with its slices listed as "pending". When plan has no `Wave:` fields, list slices as a flat numbered list under `### Wave 1 (sequential)`
- Empty blockers section

This is CRITICAL for surviving context compaction during long sessions.

### On-Demand Role Invocation

This subsection documents how on-demand roles authored by `role-planner` at Step 3.75 are invoked at runtime. The on-demand prompt files written to `~/.claude/agents/ondemand-<slug>.md` are NOT registered as native subagent types — Claude Code registers subagent types at session start, and dynamically-created prompt files cannot be invoked as direct `subagent_type: ondemand-<slug>` values mid-session. Instead, every on-demand role is invoked through the canonical `subagent_type: general-purpose` pathway by reading the prompt file at invocation time and passing its body verbatim to a general-purpose Agent tool call.

#### Frontmatter-extraction algorithm

This is the canonical algorithm for sourcing an `~/.claude/agents/ondemand-<slug>.md` prompt body at runtime. It is documented here so the on-demand prompt files you author follow a parseable contract, and so the `bootstrap-feature` command can describe the runtime invocation pattern using identical text.

1. Read the file with the Read tool.
2. If the first non-blank line is not the literal `---`, surface a malformed-frontmatter error and abort.
3. Locate the second `---` line; the prompt body is everything after it.
4. Pass the prompt body verbatim as the `prompt` parameter of an Agent tool call with `subagent_type: general-purpose`.

The four steps above are byte-pinned per architecture review `[STRUCTURAL]` decision 1. The text is byte-identical to the same algorithm documented in `src/agents/role-planner.md`. Do not paraphrase, reorder, or extend the steps — drift between the two files is a Plan Critic finding.

#### Closed-vocabulary step labels

The `Pipeline step` field of every per-role block in `.claude/roles-pending.md` MUST use exactly one of the 6 closed-vocabulary labels enumerated VERBATIM below. These are the only valid values; any other label is invalid and the role MUST be dropped or relabeled by the `role-planner` before emission:

- `Step 3.75: role-planner` — for roles invoked at the role-planner step itself (rare; mostly for meta-roles)
- `Step 4: qa-planner` — for roles that augment the QA Lead's test-case authorship
- `Step 5: planner` — for roles that contribute to the implementation plan
- `Step 6: implementation` — for roles invoked during slice implementation (the most common case)
- `Step 7: merge-ready` — for roles invoked during the merge-ready quality gate
- `Step 8: release` — for roles invoked during user-invoked /release packaging (rare; release-engineer + auxiliary release roles)

#### Failure-mode matrix

The `general-purpose` invocation pathway has three documented failure modes that the orchestrator MUST handle when invoking an on-demand role. Each row pins the surface behavior so failures are visible and not silently swallowed:

| # | Failure mode | Required behavior |
|---|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Missing on-demand prompt file at the expected path `~/.claude/agents/ondemand-<slug>.md` (e.g., the file was never written, or was deleted by a human between bootstrap and invocation) | Surface a clear error citing the missing absolute path. Abort that single invocation. Do NOT silently fall through to a default prompt or an unrelated subagent. The pipeline continues with the next role/step; only the failed invocation is aborted. |
| 2 | Malformed frontmatter — the prompt file does not begin with `---` on its first non-blank line, OR there is no closing `---` line, OR the body after the closing fence is empty | Surface a malformed-frontmatter error citing the file path. Do NOT silently spawn a `general-purpose` subagent with a corrupted prompt or a prompt-with-frontmatter-bleed. The frontmatter-extraction algorithm step (2) explicitly aborts on this condition. |
| 3 | The `tools` frontmatter field of the on-demand prompt file is unenforced at runtime — `general-purpose` subagent invocations receive a default tool surface and the `tools` list in the prompt's frontmatter is NOT runtime-enforced. This is a known iteration-1 limitation. | The on-demand prompt body MUST self-restrict by enumerating prohibited actions in the role's `## Authority boundary` section. The orchestrator MUST NOT assume that `tools: ["Read"]` actually limits the subagent to Read; it does not. Defense-in-depth lives entirely in the prompt body until iteration 2 introduces stronger enforcement. |

These three rows are the only failure modes documented for iteration 1. Additional failure modes (e.g., session-time registration failures, cross-project prompt-file collisions) are deferred per the role-planner agent's `## No iteration 2 scope` enumeration.

## Constraints

- NEVER skip the Use Cases step — all scenarios must be documented
- NEVER skip the QA step — test cases are documented before code
- Steps MUST run in order: PRD → Use Cases → Architecture → QA → Plan
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Read the project's CLAUDE.md for tech stack and architecture
